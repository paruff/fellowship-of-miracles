 I will set context we intend to create to manifest mircales in every moment. Through deliberate practice, of mindeful pray, noticing the glory of life, and stretching to explore and experience more.

We are clearly exploring to figure out how to Manifest Miracles. Some of the reading to support our discovery process include A Course in Miracles. We have faith that mindfulness and pray will guide us to how we as individual manifest mircles. 

Being clear about what manifested miracles looks, feels like is a large issue for us.

We believe the discipline of deliberate practice will help develop the skill to extend our abilities.
