Why I meditate!

I meditate to improve my relationships. Relationships with myself, partner, children and the world. You see it appears that ones ability to take perspectives is directly related to your stage on the cognitive line of development. Research points to cognitive line stalling out at about 20 years of age and the only thing that has been shown to kick it along or move it along in the years between 20 and 60 is meditation. My development was a little slow due to a hearing loss as a child and being dyslexic so my ability to take perspectives seems less then those around me and certainly less then I desire.

Cognitive development allows one to take perspectives, I can understand my partners concern for things that I may not have the same concern for as in the partner dialogue.

I started meditating years ago. When I was a teenager I had w friends one a Buddhist and another the daughter of a psychologist. She taugh me a little about Transcendental Meditation and the other offered thoughts and ideas from the Buddhist tradition. When I first started meditating I would meditate and when I stopped I would need paper to capture all the to do items I had come up with while clearing my mind ðŸ™‚ Since then I have learned some Zen meditation, if you learn such a thing and participate irregularly in an insight mediation class. I have added a couple of tools to my bag of tricks. One is a mindfulness clock and the other is a tool, holosync, to help induce the advanced or altered states of consciousness. Immrama is a less expensive solution. I hope to offer a free option in the next few weeks.

It may seem a little paradoxical that I meditate to improve my relationships. Between the sense of peace at being in the moment that meditation offers me and the increased ability to shift perspective it seems to have both confused me and allowed me to be more empathic with friends, family and the world.
