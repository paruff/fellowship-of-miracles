Who are
you? Where are you going? Who are you going with?
What do
you serve? Where do you put your energy?
Mission
Clarity Assessment Process

This is a three person,
five step process, with each step looking the same. Each step starts
with a question, in order, and then has the execution, the feedback
and then a consolidation phase.

Setup

The responder and
questioner sit across, close to each other, chair or floor. Each
person looks directly into the left eye of the other person, and
focuses their energy there. Third person is the recorder of what the responder says.
Execution

The questioner asks the
question, “[Name] who are you?” – Keep focused on the person,
you are providing a solid wall for them to bounce their ideas off of
someone.
The responder is to
keep eyes open, and answer the question until he “runs out”.
Let the questioner know when he feels done.

Then the questioner
asks the question again, same way, same focus.

The recorder is a clear and faithful scribe of the keywords words spoken by the
responder. Write legibly. It is more important to capture few, but
relevant words that the responder can read later than everything but
he cannot read it.

This (question-run
down-restate the question) cycle continues until the person is really
complete and cannot restart.
Feedback

Then the consolidation
and feedback phase starts where the responder first gives their summary
of what they heard themselves say, recorder writing this all down. Then
the questioner and recorded give their feedback, if the person wants the
feedback, and the recorder writes that down too, for the person’s
reflection later.

The Questions

    “Who are you?”
    “Where are you going?”
    “Who are you going with?”
    “What do you serve?”
    “Where do you put your energy?”

When one person is
finished (should be about 10 min per phase and 50 min per person) the
roles rotate, and another person is responder, etc.

Continue, rotate roles
so all three men have a chance to process.

Part of the process is
not to just hear who I am, and where I am going (my mission), and who
I am going with (my company) or who I serve, it is to also hear the
connection or disconnections between all four. If there is a
disconnect between who I think I am and my mission, then things won’t
be working to get my mission done. If I am not traveling with people
who can help me do what my mission is about, or who are involved in
some way with me doing my mission, then I have a disconnect and maybe
I need to find such a company.

I original experienced this process at Warrior Monk and this version of the process was provided to me by John Tittle who added the Who do I server and Where do I put my energy?
