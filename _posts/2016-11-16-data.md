Explaining the data.

 * date is the date on which I practiced
 * Sessions is the number of mindfulness sessions I engaged in, these are mindfullness sessions in which I counted my breaths to 10.
 * Present is the number of those sessions I was present at the end of 10 breaths 

Proposed refinements:

 1. remove those sessions inwhich I was not present any time
 2. present only to the tip of my nose or any such physical center
 3. expand that presence to larger and larger spheres of awareness
 4. remove sessions inwhich any mindtalk accured
 5. keep eyes closed
 6. practice with eyes open 
 7. practice in quiet
 8. practice with binural beat support
 9. practice in noisy environment
 10. practice in public
