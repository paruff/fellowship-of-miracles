title: Sharing the load through empowered delegation
---

I found some years ago, think it has been twenty ,  the stewardship delegation  structure. I found it useful then and have reason to review it now.

There are two general forms of delegation gofer and stewardship. Stewardship focuses on results while gofers on methods.

    Gofer delegation is inefficient low trust and accountability model where each action is assigned and then confirmed by either the delegate or delegator.
    Stewardship delegation requires more upfront communication and preparation with a long term payback of trust satisfaction.

Stewardship requires a clear, up-front mutual understanding of and commitment to expectations in the following five areas:

    Desired Results – Have the person see it, describe it, make a quality statement of what the results will look like and by when they will be accomplished.
    Guidelines – Identify the parameters within which the individual should operate, and what possible wrong methods or approches might be.
    Resources – Identify the resources available to accomplish the desired results.
    Accountability – Set standards of performance to be used in evaluating the results and specific times when reporting and evaluation will take place.
    Consequences – Specify what will happen as a result of the evaluation, including rewards and penalties.

Some of the challenges and benefits of stewardship are trust, maturity, conscience, agreement and accountability. When first employing the stewardship delegation consider using on yourself for a task, kind of an agreement between parts of yourself. Between the leader and the doer. This helps practice communicating the whole agreement and brings to light areas you are strong in with crafting an agreement and areas that could use strengthening before you apply this on others.

I hope you can use this kind of agreement with yourself and others and share the load and success with it.
