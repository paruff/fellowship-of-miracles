title:  Defining Deliberate Practice
---

Deliberate Practice FRAME in 5 steps:

Feedback. Deliberate practice emphasizes detail and mistakes. When a mistake happens, you’ll want to stop, acknowledge the mistake without judgment or criticism, figure out how to correct that move, visualize the correct move and then re-do using the correct move.
Repetition. Emphasize specific skills for a competitive edge by building upon your pre-existing knowledge. Remember its quality instead of quantity.
Approach. Elite athletes aren’t settling for good enough. Pushing beyond your comfort zone teaches you mental toughness and how to manage staying focused under pressure.
Motivation.  Elite athletes train hard. You’ve got to be hungry to win if you’re seeking to stand out from the pack.
Effort. Endurance and perseverance leads to mastery. Develop a consistent training schedule which emphasizes skill building.
