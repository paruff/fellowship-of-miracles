title: Ready, Fire, Aim
---

The perfect writing process is not going to come to me
without putting things out there for you to read. So many of the blogs will be
things I find in my process of liberation and I plan to spend more time working
on writing pages and courses.

Ready – intent I am always seeking liberation and always free. I
will be sharing tools, practices and processes.

Fire will be the blog entries that are great things that I want to share and
remember, maybe there

Aiming– correct and continue, will be the connecting of these different ideas,
processes and awarenessâ€™s into the pages and paths.

So it begins again. This delay is going to be one of the topics I will be
writing about if fire blogs. Critic attacks as a defense.

Feel free to challenge me to share what I am reading and learning. There is
never a time when I am not reading many books, listening to things, watching,
living and connecting the dots that seem so cool to me that I want to share
with you and all our friends.
